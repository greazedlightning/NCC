										<h3>Club History</h3>
										<p>Newbury Cricket Club is said to have been founded in
											1822, although where this information originally came from is
											no longer known. There was certainly a Newbury Club in 1850,
											and records exist of meetings held at the White Hart Hotel in
											1869 to formalise the arrangements by which pitches were to
											be prepared “on the meadow adjoining Victoria Park.” In those
											days Country House cricket was a social phenomenon, and many
											of Newbury’s fixtures were against the great Estates of the
											day – places like Highclere, Aldermaston Court, Ramsbury and
											Arlington Grange. One of this era’s leading players was J.
											Beauchamp who had played for Surrey, and was landlord of the
											local Cricketers Inn. In 1876 he made 128 against
											Basingstoke, in a total of 371, after which the opposition
											was bowled out for fifty. W.G. Grace is recorded as having
											played in a match against Newbury in the same year, and the
											club also played and beat a United South of England side
											under the captaincy of the great opera writer W.S. Gilbert,
											whose team included Jupp, Charlwood and Lillywhite – all
											famous cricketers of the time.</p>
										<p>Cricket was popular enough, and of a high enough
											standard for the club to charge admission to matches, and in
											1881this in part funded the erection of a picturesque
											thatched pavilion adjacent to the ground in Victoria Park,
											which can be seen in photographs of the period.</p>
										<p>Despite this success, in the later 1880s the club’s
											fortunes took a downward turn. Another local club, Northbrook
											CC came into existence, attracting a lot of members, so that
											by 1890 the old club found itself in financial difficulty.
											However in 1891 it seems local cricketers must have decided
											to join forces, as both clubs were dissolved and a
											reconstituted Newbury Cricket Club emerged, still based in
											Victoria Park, with Ernest Slocock as secretary and his
											brother Charles becoming club captain. J. Beauchamp had by
											this time retired as a player but had become club umpire, so
											there was obviously some continuity between the
											organisations. This merger heralded the start of what was
											possibly the strongest period in the club’s history. In 1898
											matches were hosted against the full Berkshire side, (drawn)
											and won against an M.C.C. side that included four
											professionals. Newbury’s grounds man Bill Cave was also their
											star player that year, scoring 1,042 runs including three
											centuries at an average of 37 and taking 163 wickets at only
											8 runs apiece. Maybe he knew how to produce the kind of
											pitches which suited him.</p>
										<p>The pitches must have been good however, because the
											quality of the Town Ground is mentioned in several documents,
											most notably a booklet entitled “Newbury in the Victorian
											Era” by F.H.Stillman. It was this however which lead to the
											next hiccup in the history of the club, because the rise in
											popularity of football in the early 20th century lead to the
											joint use of the ground. Newbury Town F.C. was fast becoming
											a leading light in the Berks and Bucks football association,
											and the constant pressure on the ground during the football
											season made it increasingly difficult to prepare the class of
											wickets for which Beachamp and Cave had become known. With
											the deterioration of the pitches, the class of cricket played
											also suffered</p>
										<p>Worse was to follow when at the end of the 1909 season
											a fire destroyed the pavilion, taking with it most of the
											club’s equipment. Another, more modern building was erected,
											but within only a few years the First World War brought this
											era to a close. The first class County Championship was
											abandoned, partly because public opinion was against its
											continuation in wartime, and also because many leading
											players were fighting in Germany.</p>
										<p>Presumably the same factors applied to club cricket,
											although we do not have records of how these decisions were
											made.</p>

											<em>Newbury Cricket Club would like to thank the Newbury
												Weekly News for permission to use information and extracts
												from articles written by John Taylor, which were originally
												published between 1952 and 1987, and for various photographs

										<!--<h1>1921 - 1939</h1>-->
										<p>In 1921 a meeting was held at the Guildhall to revive
											the club under the captaincy of C. Thirkhill. A young spin
											bowler by the name of Bill Charman was just starting to make
											his name in the area, and in his first senior match, aged
											sixteen he took 8 for 15. Pitches at the old town ground had
											continued to deteriorate, and at some point in the twenties
											the club began to play away matches only, Victoria Park
											finally losing its status as the headquarters of cricket in
											Newbury. At the same time however, on a small ground off
											Boundary Road in Stroud Green a new club called Westwood CC
											began to play matches in the newly founded Newbury District
											Cricket League.</p>
										<p>Without a home ground even for practice, Newbury CC
											held no attractions for young cricketers, and many of their
											members, including Charman joined Westwood, and another small
											local club called Newbury Great Western, who played on a
											ground off the Bath Road called “The Lawns.” Neither of these
											new clubs had aspirations beyond what was purely village
											cricket, but in 1929 the original Newbury CC was again
											dissolved, and with the new influx of players Westwood grew
											to take on the responsibility of being Newbury’s
											representative club. The strength of fixtures improved, soon
											including Swindon, Reading, Andover and Wokingham.</p>
										<p>In 1938, a large section of derelict land to the west
											of Northbrook Street, which up until then had been used as a
											rubbish dump, was identified by the Council as having
											potential for redevelopment as a sports ground. Plans were
											drawn up to create a new home for cricket in Newbury, and
											Westwood agreed that if they were given the use of this new
											ground at Northcroft, they would change their name to Newbury
											Cricket Club. The Club Captain at that time, A.D. Sutton, was
											a great advocate of the revival of the town club. In 1939
											Westwood’s committee, which now included Bill Charman, also
											reached agreement with Great Western for the two clubs to
											merge, but before this could be put into effect, war once
											more put a stop to organised club cricket in England. Bill
											Charman had taken 710 wickets at an average of 9.03,
											including three hat-tricks, one of which was four in four
											balls. He had also made 4,907 runs at an average of 21.91.</p>

										<!--<h1>1945 – 1952</h1>-->
										<p>During the early 1940s, work was started on the
											levelling of the ground at Northcroft, and On 1st November
											1945 the Mayor of Newbury, Mr F.D.Bazett MC invited a new
											incarnation of Newbury Cricket Club to put together a fixture
											list for the summer of 1946 at Northcroft. Sutton and Charman
											enlisted the help of the enthusiastic and capable George
											Lloyd as Secretary and on 4th May 1946 Sutton captained the
											first team ever to play cricket at Northcrcoft in a match
											against The Nautical College Pangbourne. Sid Inns (Honorary
											Secretary throughout the seventies and eighties) and Eric
											Longshaw (Fixture Secretary for many years and Club President
											to this day,) were also amongst the founder members. Not many
											clubs had yet re-formed, and there were plenty of players
											available. George Lloyd was able to put together two Saturday
											sides and a midweek team every week. He was also a successful
											fund raiser, and in 1947 a new pavilion was built, complete
											with a canteen, changing rooms and showers.</p>
										<p>Bill Charman retired in 1951, but his son Peter also
											played for the club for a while, in 1952 taking 7 for 0
											against Southampton Stoats, who before his spell had been 110
											for 2. He hit the stumps five times and was given two LBW
											decisions. Peter later told the Newbury Weekly News that his
											fondest memory was as a youngster bowling against Swindon,
											with his dad at the other end when they took all ten wickets
											between them. Peter’s time at the club was shortlived however
											– he later went on to play for Newtown CC at Horris Hill
											School, said to have been one of the finest grounds of the
											day, and joined Falkland when Newtown disbanded in 1973.
											Surely one of the most successful father and son bowling
											partnerships in local club cricket.</p>
										<img alt="Peter and Bill"
											src="http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k7/newburycc/nccwebsite/club_history/PeterandBillCharman_zps47508d6d.jpg"
											style="height: 300px" />
										<p>A.D. Sutton also retired in 1951, having partnered
											George Lloyd in forming the solid foundations of a club which
											would continue to play cricket at Northcroft up to the
											present day. He was succeeded by Malcolm Fraser, five years
											previously the Newbury Grammar School Captain, who started
											his Newbury CC career with a century against RAF Yatesbury.
											Another golden period at Newbury was beginning, with J.A.
											Mence, L.W. Ray, G.W.S. Waites and C.L.H.Cox all representing
											Berkshire. A minor Counties match was played at Northcroft,
											and in a two day game at the School Ground in Fifth Road a
											Newbury XI captained by E.B.Lloyd, who scored 67, beat Dorset
											by 8 wickets.</p>
										<p>Not everything was easy for the club however. It was
											recorded in 1952 that some townsmen, who in theory still had
											traditional rights to graze cattle and horses on the land,
											had been surreptitiously leaving the gates to the ground open
											in order to turn out their livestock on the outfield
											overnight. It is also on record that in 1955 Newbury 1st XI
											scored their lowest ever total – 19 all out at Wokingham.</p>
