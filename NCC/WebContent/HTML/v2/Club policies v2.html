										<h3>Newbury CC Missing Children Policy</h3>

										<p>
											<b> Guidance for Coaches and Volunteers</b>
										</p>

										<p>
											<b>April 2013</b>
										</p>

										<p>A child going missing can be extremely traumatic - for
											adults and children. Hopefully no child will ever go missing
											from your team or event. If they do, please remember most
											children are found within a few minutes of their
											disappearance. The following guidelines will help you to
											maximize the chances of finding any missing children quickly.</p>

										<p>
											<b>1) Keep Other Children Safe</b>
										</p>

										<p>Ensure other children in your care are looked after
											appropriately while you organise a search for the child
											concerned.</p>

										<p>
											<b>2) Inform the Parents</b>
										</p>

										<p>Inform the child's parents if they are present at the
											event, or nominate an appropriate person to telephone them
											and advise them of the concern. Reassure them you are doing
											all you can to locate their child. Remember the child may
											contact the parents directly so this action is very
											important.</p>

										<p>
											<b>3) Organize a Search</b>
										</p>

										<p>Organize all available responsible adults by areas to
											be searched. It is best to take a short time to plan the
											search so that all places are searched fully. Start with the
											area from which the child has gone missing and include
											changing rooms, toilets, public, private and storage areas
											and the club's grounds.</p>

										<p>
											<b>4) Contact Point</b>
										</p>

										<p>Nominate an adult, (this could be you or another
											responsible person,) to remain at a specific position as
											Coordinator and ask all searchers to report back to this
											person. The Coordinator should stay at this reference point
											and make a note of events, including a detailed physical
											description of the child. This should include approximate
											height, build, hair and eye colour as well as the clothing
											the child was wearing and where and when they were last seen.
											All this will be required by the police. If the search is
											unsuccessful you should then contact the police. A report
											should go to the police no later than 20 minutes after the
											child's disappearance is noted, even if the search is not
											complete.</p>

										<p>
											<b>5) Be Guided by the Police</b>
										</p>

										<p>If the police recommend further action before they get
											involved, follow their guidance. If the police act upon the
											concern, always be guided by them in any further actions to
											take. At any stage when the child is located, ensure you
											inform all adults involved including the parents, searchers
											and the police if, by then, they are involved.</p>

										<p>
											<b>6) Report to Welfare Teams</b>
										</p>

										<p>
											All missing child incidents must be notified at the very
											earliest opportunity to the Club Welfare Officer, Jeanette
											Smith, 31 Chestnut Crescent, Newbury Berks RG14 1LG. Tel:
											01635 528889 / 07709 201531, email <a
												href="mailto:smiths31@sky.com">smiths31@sky.com</a>, who
											will immediately notify the County Welfare Officer, and they
											must then notify the ECB Child Protection Team.

										<h3>Changing, Showering, Kit Policy</h3>
										<p>
											<b>Newbury Cricket Club - Junior Section</b>
										</p>

										<p>Whilst NCC provide some kit, parents should provide
											wherever possible the appropriate protective equipment. Under
											no circumstances should boxer shorts be worn to training or
											in a match. Any junior wearing boxers will not be allowed to
											bat for their own safety.</p>

										<p>Changing facilities at Newbury Cricket Club are
											available for both male and female. However, showering
											facilities are available for male only.</p>

										<br />
										<p># Adults must not change, or shower, at the same time
											using the same facility as the juniors</p>

										<p># Adults should try to change at separate times to
											juniors during matches, for example when juniors are padding
											up</p>

										<p># If adults and juniors need to share a changing
											facility, the club must have consent from parents that their
											child(ren) can share a changing room with adults in the club</p>

										<p># If juniors play for adult teams, they and their
											parents, must be informed of the club's policy on changing
											arrangements</p>

										<p># Mixed gender teams must have access to separate male
											and female changing rooms</p>

										<p># Mobile phones must not be used in changing rooms</p>

										<p># If juniors are uncomfortable changing or showering at
											the club, no pressure should be placed on them to do so.
											Instead the Club suggest they change and shower at home</p>

										<h3>Anti-Bullying and the Code of Conduct Policy</h3>
										<p>
											<b>Newbury Cricket Club - Junior Section</b>
										</p>


										<h4>Statement of intent</h4>

										<p>NCC are committed to providing a caring, friendly and
											safe environment for all of our juniors so they can train and
											play, in a relaxed and secure atmosphere. Bullying of any
											kind is unacceptable at our club. If bullying does occur, all
											juniors should be able to tell, and know that incidents will
											be dealt with promptly and effectively. NCC are a TELLING
											club. This means anyone who knows bullying is happening is
											expected to tell staff and officials.</p>
										<h4>What is bullying</h4>

										<p>
											Bullying is the use of aggression with the intention of
											hurting another person. Bullying results in pain and distress
											to the victim. Bullying can take many forms some of which are
											listed below: <br /> • Emotional: being unfriendly,
											excluding, tormenting (for example: hiding kit, or making

										<h4>Why is it important to respond to bullying?</h4>

										<p>Bullying hurts. No one should be a victim of bullying.
											Everyone has the right to be treated with respect. Juniors
											who are bullying need to learn different ways of behaving.</p>
										<p>Newbury Cricket Club adopts a responsibility to respond
											promptly and effectively to issues of bullying.</p>

										<h4>Objectives of this policy</h4>
										<p>• All officials, coaching and non-coaching staff,
											juniors and parents should have an understanding of what
											bullying is</p>
										<br />
										<p>• All officials, coaching and non-coaching staff should
											know what the club policy is on bullying, and follow it when
											bullying is reported</p>
										<br />
										<p>• All juniors and parents should know what the club
											policy is on bullying, and what they should do if bullying
											arises</p>
										<br />
										<p>• As a club, we take bullying seriously. Juniors and
											parents should be assured they will be supported when
											bullying is reported</p>
										<br />
										<p>• Bullying will not be tolerated</p>

										<br />
										<p>• All officials, coaching and non-coaching staff should
											know what the club policy is on bullying, and follow it when
											bullying is reported</p>

										<h4>Signs and symptoms</h4>
										<p>A junior may indicate, by signs or behaviour, that he
											or she is being bullied. Adults should be aware of signs and
											investigate if a junior:</p>

										<p>• Says they are being bullied</p>

										<p>• Changes their usual routine</p>

										<p>• Is unwilling to go to the club</p>

										<p>• Becomes withdrawn, anxious, or lacking in confidence</p>

										<p>• Comes home with clothes torn or belongings damaged</p>

										<p>• Has possessions which are damaged or go missing</p>

										<p>• Asks for money or starts stealing money (to pay the
											bully)</p>

										<p>• Unexplained cuts or bruises</p>

										<p>• Is frightened to say what's wrong</p>

										<p>• Gives improbable excuses for any of the above</p>

										<p>In more extreme cases, the junior:</p>

										<p>• Starts stammering</p>

										<p>• Cries themselves to sleep at night or has nightmares</p>

										<p>• Becomes aggressive, disruptive or unreasonable</p>

										<p>• Is bullying other children or siblings</p>

										<p>• Stops eating</p>

										<p>• Attempts or threatens suicide or runs away</p>

										<p>These signs and behaviours could indicate other
											problems, but bullying could be a possibility and should be
											investigated.</p>

										<h4>Procedures</h4>
										<p>Report bullying incidents to the Club Welfare Officer -
											see Membership Form</p>

										<p>• In cases of serious bullying, the incidents will be
											reported to the ECB Child Protection Team for advice via the
											County Welfare Officer</p>

										<p>• Parents should be informed and will be asked to come
											to a meeting to discuss the problem</p>

										<p>• If necessary and appropriate, police will be
											consulted</p>

										<p>• The bullying behaviour or threats of bullying must be
											investigated and the bullying stopped quickly</p>

										<p>• An attempt will be made to help the bully</p>

										<p>(bullies) change their behaviour</p>

										<p>In cases of adults reported to be bullying cricketers
											under 18, the ECB will always be informed and will advise on
											action to be taken.</p>

										<h4>Prevention</h4>
										<p>We will use KIDSCAPE methods to help juniors prevent
											bullying. As and when appropriate, these may include:</p>

										<p>• Writing a set of club rules</p>

										<p>• Signing a behaviour contract</p>

										<p>• Having discussions about bullying and why it matters</p>
